# ZeGiBl

ZeGiBl (sounds like legible) is a portmanteau of ZeptoJS, Gist, and Blog. ZeGiBl relies on Github Gists for CRUD actions on blog posts and relies on client-side JavaScript to render gists. ZeGiBl uses Github Gists for data storage, zeptojs as a lightweight jquery surrogate, and markedjs for parsing markdown.
